# Duolingo Clone 🎵

A Duolingo clone. I created this clone to gain experience in TypeScript and for learning new languages.

## 🎥 Demo/Preview

## 🚦 Running the Project

You can run the application by visiting my website at [https://duolingo-clone.andrew-dev.com/](https://duolingo-clone.andrew-dev.com/)

## ⚡ Technologies

### App:

- `React.js`
- `TypeScript`
- `WordPress`: Used as the backend, offering RESTful services and content management.
- `Emotion (babel-plugin, core, css, react, styled)`
- `Axios`: For making HTTP requests.
- `Bootstrap`
- `React Router DOM`: For routing and navigation.

## 🚀 How it works

The main functionality of the project is creating sentences

👨‍💻 The user is presented with a few words to choose from
🤔 Then, they select words from the screen to build a sentence
✔️ Upon submitting, the application indicates whether the constructed sentence is correct.

🛠 For the backend, I've employed WordPress, coupled with the Advanced Custom Fields and ACF to REST API plugins.

## 💭 Process and Project Structure

1. The journey began with designing in Figma. I borrowed certain elements from the original Duolingo.
2. For the backend, WordPress was my choice. With the Advanced Custom Fields plugin and the ACF to REST API plugin, it became the backbone of my application. This setup empowers me to introduce new languages, define language-specific topics, and craft sentences for those topics.
3. Several key pages were brought to life:

### Project Structure

- `Main page`
- `Select language`. For example, English.
- `Choose a topic`. For example, Present Simple.
- `Sentence Builder`. This is where users engage in sentence construction. For example, you need to translate from Russian to English.

## 🤔 How can it be improved?

- Add a dark theme
- A counter for created sentences, letting users monitor their progress.
- Add animations as in Duolingo

In general, mirroring Duolingo's interactive behavior could be the way forward.
